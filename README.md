This is a repository for my group's thesis: a swarm of surface vehicles that are able to communicate with one another in cleaning oceans.

## Our advocacy
The Philippines is one of the world's largest ocean polluter. In fact, some studies claim it might just be ***number 1***. My group hopes to present a solution to that problem in the way we know how: automation.

Our idea stems from the fact that picking up trash that floats in the shore is a monotonous task; you see plastic, you pick it up, and then you throw it into a bag. What if you take that action and put it in a loop?

Even better: have machines do it; machines that do not tire and can go to deeper and dangerous parts of bodies of water that an average human won't dare to go.
