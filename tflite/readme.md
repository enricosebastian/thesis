## Welcome to the tflite folder
This is where the files regarding TensorFlow and TensorFlow lite exist. This should primarily run on a PC--specifically a Linux-based system.

## Folder structure
- `Demo` - Test files that prove certain systems are working
- `models` - Where the initial transfer learning model `efficientdet_lite0.tflite` is stored
- `prototype` - All of the current and previous versions of the files we used during our experimentation
