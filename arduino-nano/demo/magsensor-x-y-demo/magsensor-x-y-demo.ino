/***************************************************************************
  This is a library example for the HMC5883 magnentometer/compass

  Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit HMC5883 Breakout
  http://www.adafruit.com/products/1746
 
  *** You will also need to install the Adafruit_Sensor library! ***

  These displays use I2C to communicate, 2 pins are required to interface.

  Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code,
  please support Adafruit andopen-source hardware by purchasing products
  from Adafruit!
